				<h3>Notes</h3>
	      <p>ESPN used to have a public API for developers to iterate off of, but they shelved that project down a couple of years ago to <i>focus on their own internal products</i>.
					After some digging through the ESPN site's JavaScript files and on GitHub, I was able to Macgvyer together a URL to access current college football scores and even request them by date.
					And so, this API was born.</p>
				<p>This API is designed with FBS schools in mind, but ESPN may return FCS schools in their responses. These schools will not have links to historical data or matchup history.</p>
				<p>All requests should be made with GET. No authentication needed.</p>
				<p>Currently, only date, week, and season queries are supported. I hope to bring more functionality to this API soon.</p>
			</div>

      <div id="date">
				<h3>Retreiving games by date</h3>
				<h4>Parameters</h4>
				<pre>?date={string:date}</pre>
				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>Queries with this parameter will return the games played or to be played on the date given. When using this parameter, make sure to convert your date to YYYYMMDD format.</p>
				<p><b>NOTE</b>: This parameter will only return data for the current season. If you want data from previous seasons, see the <a href="#season">seasons</a> parameter.</p>

				<h3>Retreiving games by season</h3>
				<h4>Parameters</h4>

				<p>Queries with these paramters will return historical data for the season and week provided. Historical data is available from 1985 to 2014 via <a href="https://collegefootballapi.com">College Football API</a>.</p>
				<p><b>NOTE</b>: While the schema for games is the same as that for the latest data from ESPN, there is not as much metadata avilable for each game.
					This is mainly due to me not being able to successfully write asynchronus requests and retrieve that data.
					As a stopgap, I have included the URL to query for that data. If you know how to fix this issue, please submit a <a href="https://github.com/akeaswaran/cfb-scoreboard-api/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>
